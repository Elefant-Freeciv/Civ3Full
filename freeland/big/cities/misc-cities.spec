;
; The names for city tiles are not free and must follow the following rules.
; The names consists of style name, _ , size. The style name is as specified
; in cities.ruleset file. The size indicates which size city must
; have to be drawn with a tile. E.g. european_4 means that the tile is to be
; used for cities of size 4+ in european style. Obviously the first tile
; must be style_name_0. The sizes must be in ascending order.
; There must also be a 'style_name'_wall_0 tile used
; for the default wall graphics and an occupied tile to indicate
; a military units in a city.
; For providing multiple walls buildings (as requested by the "Visible_Walls"
; effect value) tags are 'style_name'_bldg_'effect_value'_'index'
; The maximum size supported now is 31, but there can only be MAX_CITY_TILES
; normal tiles. The constant is defined in common/city.h and set to 8 now.
